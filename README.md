# YourTime
Shows you your time

We would like you to create a simple Android application using Xamarin.
The initial screen says, "Hello World." 
After a few seconds, transition to a new screen.
The new screen shows a username, avatar, and their local timezone HH:MM in 24 hours mode (this must show my local timezone without you knowing what time I'm in right now, and if someone else installs the app, it will show her timezone instead of mine).
In the middle of the screen, show a dynamic face clock with that time, and a button that makes the time go backward by 1 hour every time it is pressed.
Clicking a button at the very bottom of the screen will exit the application.
 
Project outline
 
•	Set up project 2 pages
•	http://avatars.adorable.io/ make the avatar generate from username
•	https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-box-view-clock-in-xamarin-forms/ create the clock

1.	I made the avatar change, so try different usernames, there awesome!
2.	I copied the Clockface from the web, but I changed the layout some and encapsulated the logic in a helper class.
I did not write more detail because I was having fun and lost myself for a few hours.
